##Updates

-----

* __Second major update! (Dec 28 10pm -> Dec 29 7:30am)__

Great, lots of neatening and added step 3 as well 

-----

Scss is slightly (work in progress) more readable

__Added mixins for DRY-ness and readability__

__More comments__


.js file has been updated with more animations (work in progress) 

-----

Step 3 (work in progress) added

__Added Main components; a top "selection segment"; a bottom "Add to cart segment"__

__Proportions of components are completed__

-----
* __NEXT TO DO:__


1. Continue tidying upp SCSS; use bootstrap names where possible; Restructure SCSS classes to improve readability
2. NOTE: Mobile hover issues
3. 
	Step 3: 
	- Add div container for parameters (size, color, etc.) and arrange text on top
	- Edit div container for X symbol
	- Discuss where to implement "Quantity" label (i.e. Below other parameters? Color, size, quantity. OR Above/ Beside the TOTAL label?)
	- Plan: .js will hide irrelavant parameters upon selection (i.e. When user clicks on Size, the correponding advoc-select-size container is revealed on the right hand side)
	- Add "add to cart" animations 
	
	(AS MENTIONED: __foresees user have to wait after clicking a button; ensure they are aware: something in the background__)

__End of updates__

* __Initial commit__

Okay, I'll try to keep this concised, but it's supposed to log all the (correct/ completed) things that I've done.

Nearly lost all my work an hour ago.. But luckily dropbox had version histories, haha.

Anyway, below are the current updates:

-----


* __First Git Sync (22 Dec 4:30am):__


-----
Changed/ redid entire .CSS file into .SCSS file.

__Added more comments in .scss files as a guide__

-----
Corrected overlay size

Added :hover effect (Will not work on mobile though; we need some discussion on this) 

Corrected white space problem (I'd experimented quite a few solutions and decided vertical-align of display:table will be the best method)

Fixed text sizes and proportions (i.e. Make all of the text sizes more similar to the mockups)

Redid buttons (Logo is positioned better)

-----
__(In step 2)__

Created internal padding for textarea

Fixed position and size of logo in text area.

Fixed buttons

Created twitter layout (+colors +logos +buttons)

-----
* __NEXT TO DO:__

1. Redo media queries for different mobile sizes (Simulate different device viewports) and correct any display issues
2. Discuss changes that might have to be made from the design (A. Mobile :hover issues B. I removed a few weird paddings as seen in the design I'd received, for example the padding on the right in the textarea of step 2.)
3. Discuss how to move on to step 3 (Or improve on existing transitions). I suppose you guys already have a server set up for sharing purposes? Do I need to put in a caller for FB/TW APIs? Or how else should I make the HTML file? (Currently, the share button will submit the form into another file)


advocado-overlays
=================

##Background

Advocado is revising its overlays. The objectives:

* mobile compatibility and responsiveness
* better aesthetic to improve conversion, i.e. make people want to share more and get the discount

As such we have come up with a set of designs that we would like to convert into actual HTML/CSS. 

An actual demo of Advocado can be found [here](http://www.goodnightmacaroon.co/collections/biggest-christmas-sale/products/pea-coat-double-breasted). Click on the "Click for 20% Discount" button.

##Guidelines

The below are some things we learnt that you may already know. If you do already know all this, please bear with me:

* Widgets are not as straightforward to write as normal websites. They don't exist on their own and may require libraries that conflict with those existing on the websites they are being displayed on. 

* Also, widgets have to be very small and compact. They have to minimise on libraries because that will slow down loading.

* We need to aim to be responsive, i.e. if we foresee that the user will have to wait after clicking a button, we will need to ensure that they are aware that something is happening in the background. You can see [this page](http://lab.hakim.se/ladda/) as an example. 

##Style Guide

* __ALL__ CSS class names that we specify should be preceded with "advoc-". This prevents conflicts with existing classes on the store.

* Do a CSS reset before specifying the various CSS rules for your custom components.

* Read up a bit on [OOCSS](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) and try as far as possible to use SASS. This may take a while so I'm OK that you pick up SASS slowly.


##Process

* __Github & Git__

  We will be using git and github to manage code and conduct progress reviews.

* __Pull requests as code review__

  As part of this mentorship, I hope to get to see frequent pull requests. In the 1st week, I hope to be able to see a pull request every 1-2 days so we can quickly rectify style issues and other tiny stuff. I don't mind if you're not committing and pushing large amounts of code; more importantly I just want to see something.

  We can ease up on this once we agree you are on firmer ground. 

* __Screenhero__

  I'm not going to be very responsive all the way until after 10th Dec 2013. But I am free to Screenhero in the late evenings.

* __IM (Google Hangouts/Line/iMessage)__

  Let's pick a tool for IM, so you can reach me easily. I am also OK with iMessage if that's your preferred way.  Hangouts allows for video chats and screen-sharing, which is quite desirable as well.

##Getting Started

1.  Fork the repository and clone it to a folder (best if it's in a public Dropbox folder so I can load it in a browser to see how it looks).

2. Start creating/updating HTML and CSS files (I'll probably upload a skeleton in a while), committing code and pushing them to your fork. Try to replicate what's in the PDFs.

3. Submit a pull request via github's interface. I'll take a look and comment on it.  I can also view it on Dropbox.

4. Discuss via IM and the various tools.

5. Step 2 again.

##Presentation

* As mentioned above, let's view your work via a public folder in Dropbox and Github (pull requests).

##Miscellaneous

* Feel free to experiment with technologies as you are writing. Go ahead and play with tools like Grunt to do CSS and HTML minification. It'll take some time to pick up but it's definitely useful.
